## Who am i?

Heyo! i'm tommaso dighero aka ElPlatypo, im a software enthusiast who dabbles in many things, from 3D rendering to rust simulations! i have a background in physics and studied it at university.

I love working on DIY projects that both have to do with software and hardware, nothing better than the smell of fresh soldering paste in the morning.
I strongly believe in open-source and giving the people the power to do things by themselves!
